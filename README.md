# ANN-SpenceR
Spencer's First Try at Artificial Neural Network

Dad's notes:  Spencer taught himself Python Programing towards the end of last year in his free time. And has since created classic neural network programs that can simulate logic gates, He built another ANN that can look at a word and determine if it is English or German..  And his most recent try is this ANN which can read in some text, and predect or output what looks "sort of" like the input text.
